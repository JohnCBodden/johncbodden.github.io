											<h3>About Me</h3>
											<p>Having spent the past 25+ years within the Information Technology field I have garnered diverse and extensive experience throughout my professional career, including, and not limited to; security, networking, troubleshooting, installations and web development, and all the matters related to the aforementioned.</p>
									<p>As the IT Industry continues to rapidly evolve and the absolute need for organizations to remain highly defended against potential threats by remaining many steps ahead of potential cyber-attacks; I am confident that my training and qualification as a ‘Certified Penetration Testing Engineer’ (“Ethical Hacker”) can prove to be an asset to any firm. This coveted designation has instilled the valuable ability to anticipate potential threats and plots of a cyber-criminal as well as knowledge and training with the various tools utilized to initiate attacks. By knowing and understanding the thought patterns and “virtual arsenal” used by cyber-criminals, I am best-placed to ensure that processes are implemented before threats emerge.</p>
									<p>During my professional career I have overseen the network security of local eCommerce Gateways in which my duties included ensuring the safety and security of card data of thousands of customers. Over the decade which I provided this service there was not a single breach or interception of customer data.</p>
