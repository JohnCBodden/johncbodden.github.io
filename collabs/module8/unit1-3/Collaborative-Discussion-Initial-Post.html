									<div class="panel">
									<span class="image featured"><img src="../../../images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>The British Computer Society (BCS) (BCS Code of Conduct, no date) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) (ACM code of ethics, 2018) are two of the most prominent computing organisations globally. The BCS is dedicated to promoting professional development and ethical practice in the United Kingdom, while the ACM supports innovation, education, and research in computing worldwide. </p>
									<p>Both organisations have codes of ethics and professional conduct that help guide computing professionals. The BCS code emphasises professional development and social responsibility, while the ACM code is more specific to computing and technology-related issues.</p>
									<p>Concerns have been raised about Blocker Plus, a content filtering system with significant legal, social, and professional implications. Although initially created to comply with the U.S. Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), it was discovered that the system was also blocking unrelated content, raising concerns about freedom of speech and access to information (Case: Malicious Inputs to content filters, 2018). (ACM code of ethics, 2018) By blocking content related to critical societal issues such as vaccination and climate change, the public's access to information can be hindered. Furthermore, blocking content related to gay and lesbian marriage contributes to discrimination against LGBTQ+ communities. The lack of transparency regarding the system's limitations and potential biases highlights a failure in professional communication. As computing professionals, we must ensure our work does not harm individuals or communities. This case underscores the importance of upholding ethical standards and professionalism in computing.</p>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Public Interest:</strong> Although Blocker Plus aimed to comply with the U.S. Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), inadvertently blocking legitimate content on critical societal issues contradicts this principle (BCS Code of Conduct, no date).</li>
											<li><strong>Professional Competence and Integrity: </strong> The lack of caution and disclosure regarding the system's limitations and potential biases violates the principles of honesty and integrity outlined in the BCS Code (BCS Code of Conduct, no date).</li>
											<li><strong>Duty to Relevant Authority: </strong> Accidentally blocking content unrelated to CIPA guidelines raises concerns about possible legal and regulatory violations (BCS Code of Conduct, no date).</li>
											<li><strong>Professional Responsibility: </strong> Failing to address content blocking and discrimination issues adequately reflects a breach of professional responsibility outlined in the BCS Code (BCS Code of Conduct, no date).</li>
											<li><strong>Duty to Society: </strong> As outlined in the BCS Code, failure to promote access to diverse and relevant information undermines society's well-being (BCS Code of Conduct, no date).</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<p>The BCS and ACM offer ethical guidelines for computing professionals. The Blocker Plus case has sparked debates about free speech and information access, emphasising the significance of ethical conduct in computing. The principles outlined in the BCS Code of Conduct, such as prioritising public interest, maintaining professional competence and integrity, adhering to relevant authority, taking professional responsibility, and serving society, apply to the Blocker Plus scenario.</p>

									<p>(Case: Malicious Inputs to content filters, 2018) The Blocker Plus case studies are an absolute reminder of the ethical responsibilities of computing professionals, as demonstrated by the British Computer Society (BCS) (BCS Code of Conduct, no date) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) (ACM code of ethics, 2018). Blocker Plus, a content filtering system designed to comply with the U.S. Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) (CIPA, 2004), unintentionally blocked legitimate content on crucial societal issues, sparking significant legal, social, and professional concerns. (Alrizah et al., 2019) The inadvertent blocking of content related to vaccination, climate change, and LGBTQ+ rights highlights the potential harm such systems can cause, necessitating a broader consideration of their impact on public interest.</p>
									<p>The case (Case: Malicious Inputs to content filters, 2018) also highlights the utmost importance of transparency in the context of content filtering systems. It's not just crucial; it's a moral imperative to openly communicate system limitations and potential biases, as failing can lead to unintended consequences and undermine public trust. Professionals must uphold principles of honesty and integrity to ensure that their systems do not inadvertently harm individuals or communities.</p>
									<p>Through learning from the Blocker Plus case, computing professionals can adeptly navigate the ethical complexities of content filtering systems, ensuring that these tools serve the public interest while upholding the highest standards of professional conduct and integrity. This highlights the crucial role of the audience in shaping the future of content filtering systems, empowering them to take responsibility (ACM code of ethics, 2018).</p>
